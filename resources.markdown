To demonstrate the benefits of working with RISE and to encourage third-party development of SHINE -compatible technical solutions, a suite of open-source toolkits is available for others to adopt and adapt for their own purposes. They can be found on the [RISE Project's Github page](https://github.com/RISE-MPIWG).

### [RISE Resource Provider Application](https://github.com/RISE-MPIWG/rise_rp) ###

This application allows you to maintain collections, resources, sections and content units and make them available through a SHINE-compatible api. It relies on docker for development as well as for deployment.

### [React SHINE Module](https://github.com/RISE-MPIWG/react-shine-api) ###

This is a React.js component that allows users to browse the [SHINE API](https://rise.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/collections). It allows selection of files, and passes the selected files through to your app. This component is currently used on Pelagios' [Recogito Platform](https://recogito.pelagios.org/)

### [Docusky Widget](https://github.com/RISE-MPIWG/docusky_widget) ###

This Vue.js widget allows the [Docusky](https://docusky.org.tw/DocuSky/ds-01.home.html) platform to pull resources from RISE.

### [RISE API JS Library](https://github.com/RISE-MPIWG/rise_js_client) ###

This library is designed to allow developers to interact easily with APIs compatible with SHINE, a restful API protocol that allows clients to browse, filter and access a large number of open and licence-protected structured text resources from a wide variety of providers. Please visit https://rise.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de for more information about SHINE and the RISE project. For a more detailed documentation of this project, please visit https://rise.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/jslib.

### [RISE Python Script](https://github.com/RISE-MPIWG/hylg)

This Python script allows one to pull text from RISE, and can be easily modified for your needs.
